# myaliases
Bash aliases and functions for various things. If you're compiling C++ for Harvey Mudd's CS70 course, you will find .bash_cpp especially useful.

EDIT: Makefiles do everything .bash_cpp does, but more efficiently and better. 

# setup
Clone this repository and run the `setup` script to get started. 

The `setup` script can be run without any parameters to include everything in the repository, or it can be run with parameters containing the suffixes of the files you want to use. You can run setup again later to add additional files. 
Example: `./setup nav studycloud`

# uninstall
The `uninstall` script will remove all traces of myaliases from your `.bash_aliases` and delete your locally set preferences. You can also use this if you want to reset your local preferences and start over. 

# thanks
Feel free to fork and use/modify as you please.
