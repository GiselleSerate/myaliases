# myaliases
Bash aliases that I have found useful. 

# usage
Clone this repository into `~` and add the following to your .bashrc for each file you want to use:
```
if [ -f ~/myaliases/.bash_aliases_cpp ]; then
  . ~/myaliases/.bash_aliases_cpp
fi
```
When you're done, remember to run `source .bashrc` from `~`. 

# thanks
Feel free to fork and use/modify as you please.
