# some subshell-related tricks and aliases

# The subtrap command allows for easy, automatic, guaranteed trapping
# By running your commands in a subshell, you don't have to worry about
# conflicting traps or setting multiple traps for many different signals
# (since the only important signal is the subshell's EXIT)
#
# param1: the set of clean up commands
# param2+: any set of commands to execute in the subshell
subtrap() {
	(
		trap "$1" EXIT
		shift
		eval "$@"
	)
}
